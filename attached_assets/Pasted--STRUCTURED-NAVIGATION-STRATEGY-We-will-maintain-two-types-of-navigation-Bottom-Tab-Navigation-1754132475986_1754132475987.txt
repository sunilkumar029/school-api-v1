✅ STRUCTURED NAVIGATION STRATEGY
We will maintain two types of navigation:

🔽 Bottom Tab Navigation → Only for:
Home

Notifications

Settings

📂 Side Drawer Menu → For all other pages:
Events, Wallet, Analytics, Food Court, Timesheet, Users, Chat, etc.

This keeps the bottom tab simple, uncluttered, and moves heavy modules to a logical drawer-based secondary menu.
