Objective:
Update the remaining screens with standardized filter UI (ModalDropdownFilter), global filter integration (useGlobalFilters()), and consistent error/loading/empty state handling. Focus on completing the finance, exams, and tasks modules.

‚úÖ Target Screens for This Phase:
app/tasks/add-task.tsx

Apply consistent form layout and card styling.

Ensure any dropdowns use ModalDropdownFilter.

Add safe data handling for date pickers, user selectors, etc.

Implement global filters if relevant (branch, academic year).

app/tasks/edit-task.tsx

Same updates as add-task.tsx.

Ensure all fields are editable and error-checked.

Apply shared design system for buttons, form spacing, and inputs.

app/finance/salary-template.tsx

Replace any filter dropdowns with ModalDropdownFilter.

Integrate useGlobalFilters() for department, branch if applicable.

Ensure filter layout is consistent with dashboard styles.

app/finance/school-expenditure.tsx

Standardize filters (category, date range, status).

Use ModalDropdownFilter and horizontal scroll if needed.

Handle null/undefined data and enhance error/loading states.

app/exams/student-marks-analytics.tsx

Replace department and day dropdowns with modal filters.

Integrate global filters.

Ensure table/chart displays are responsive and error-proof.

Fix any layout or data rendering inconsistencies.

üìå Implementation Checklist:
 All dropdowns use ModalDropdownFilter (no Picker/legacy).

 Global filters integrated via useGlobalFilters().

 Null/undefined checks for all object property access.

 Standardized loading/error/empty UI states applied.

 Form styling and dropdown spacing match the design system.

 Date/time pickers and text inputs follow reusable patterns.

 Scroll behavior managed properly (horizontal + vertical).

 Removed unused imports and cleaned legacy code.

üîÅ Shared Standards to Follow:
Component structure should follow other updated screens.

Use consistent padding, spacing, card elevation.

Maintain consistent typography and color schemes.

Use proper fallback UI (Loading spinner, "No Records Found", "Retry").

Ensure all inputs are touch-friendly and screen-reader accessible.
