🔎 Pending Screens to Implement (Next Steps)
Here’s what’s clearly missing from your list and needs to be implemented:

🔸 1. File Management
📍 Suggested file: file-management.tsx

Key Features:
Upload, preview, download files

Folder & file tagging

Role-based access (admin, teacher)

Filter by type/owner/date

Share files with classes/students

🔸 2. Academics Module
Should be broken into multiple screens:

A. academics/teacher-performance.tsx
Evaluation metrics

Review system by management

B. academics/student-performance.tsx
Performance charts

Subject-wise breakdown

C. academics/classroom.tsx
Shared class board

Notes, discussions, tasks

D. academics/online-class.tsx
Schedule & join sessions

Zoom/Meet integration

E. academics/staff-timetable.tsx
Staff-wise calendar

Slot assignment

F. academics/class-timetable.tsx
Period management per class

G. academics/student-marks.tsx
Entry form, table view

Grade calculation

H. academics/student-attendance.tsx
Calendar view

Mark presence

📍 Suggest creating a folder:
app/academics/ with each of the above as separate files.

🔸 3. Exams Module
📍 Suggested folder: app/exams/

A. create-question.tsx
Add MCQ/Subjective with editor

Link to class & subject

B. schedule-exam.tsx
Assign exams to timetable

Add duration, room, instructions

🔸 4. Classes > Subjects Module (if applicable)
If subjects are managed separately from classes, you may need:
📍 subjects.tsx

CRUD subjects

Assign to classes & teachers

📂 Suggested Folder Structure Going Forward

│   └── schedule-exam.tsx
├── file-management.tsx
├── subjects.tsx (if needed)
You can move other domain-based features like foodcourt, wallet, chat into folders later if needed, but for now they work well in (tabs)/.

🧠 Suggested Work Order (Best UX Progression)
✅ File Management (most reusable + easy win)

🎓 Academics (start with Student Marks + Attendance)

🧾 Exams (basic scheduling and question bank)

📆 Staff/Class Timetables

🧑‍🏫 Performance/Analytics Dashboards
