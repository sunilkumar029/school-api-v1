Task:
Perform a complete review and refactor of all API-integrated screens in the application with the following objectives:

🔁 1. Remove All Duplications
Identify and eliminate all redundant code, logic, and UI components across all API-based screens.

Centralize shared logic and styling into reusable components or utilities.

🎨 2. Unify Filters (Branch + Academic Year)
Implement a consistent global filter system that includes:

Branch Selector

Academic Year Selector

These filters must:

Be accessible from the Dashboard and every API-integrated screen

Dynamically affect the API responses across all relevant screens based on selection

Retain screen-specific filters as needed (e.g., status, date range, type), but in combination with the global filters

⚙️ 3. Fix Errors & Ensure Functional Consistency
Go through every API-connected page and:

Fix broken functionalities

Standardize error handling

Ensure consistent UI/UX behavior across all screens

Respect the selected global filters (branch + academic year) on all API requests

📊 4. Dashboard Updates
Add global Branch and Academic Year selectors at the top of the Dashboard

Ensure all dashboard metrics and data respect these filters

📋 Expected Workflow
Audit All API-Integrated Screens

List each screen that uses backend data

Design and Implement Unified Global Filters

Place in app header/top bar or as a persistent drawer

Store selection in global context/state

Apply Fixes and Refactor Each Screen

Apply global filters

Remove duplicate code

Unify styling and layout

Fix broken logic or UI issues

Report Progress

Maintain a checklist of screens:

✅ Completed

🔧 In Progress

❌ Needs Refactoring

Notify after each phase/screen is completed

Start this refactor with a full plan, execute it independently, and keep track of each screen's progress. Once done, provide a status report with:

List of fixed screens
