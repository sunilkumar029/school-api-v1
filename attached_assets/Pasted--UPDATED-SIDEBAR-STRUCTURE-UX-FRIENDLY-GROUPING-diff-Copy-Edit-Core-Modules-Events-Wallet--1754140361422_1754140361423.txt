Icons + titles for better navigation

Use toggle to hide/show extra pages for role-specific UX

🧩 Submodules:
All pages must:

Use same padding/margin system

Support light/dark theme

Show breadcrumbs (e.g., Academics > Student Marks)

Include action FAB (floating action buttons) where needed

Ensure accessibility (font size scaling)

📱 RESPONSIVENESS & MOBILE-SPECIFIC
Use segmented control or vertical tabs for submodules

Collapse tables into cards for small screens

Modal bottom-sheets for forms and filters

Use pagination or infinite scroll where data-heavy (e.g., student list)
