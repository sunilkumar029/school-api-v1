✅ Final Development Prompt: Stationery Module (CRUD + Integration)
🛠️ 1. 📥 Data Source: Use /api/standards/ for Stationery Details
The API /api/standards/ provides stationery-related fields.
You need to:

Extract stationery-specific fields from each standard (e.g., stationary_fee, stationary_items, or similar keys).

Display them in a Stationery Page.

🧭 2. 🎛 Common Filters on Top of Page
Across the Stationery Page, maintain consistent filters like all other modules:

✅ Branch dropdown (from /api/branches/)

✅ Academic Year dropdown (from /api/academic-years/)

✅ Search bar (to search standards or stationery items)

✅ Use an Accordion-style filter button for clean UI.

🧠 Tip: Wrap filter state globally or persist using Context or Redux if shared.

📋 3. 📦 Stationery List Page
Table/List Layout showing:

Standard	Items	Quantity	Total Fee	Action
Class 6	Notebooks, Pen	5 each	₹200	View/Edit/Delete

Each row should show:

List of stationery items

Their quantities

Associated fee

🖱️ Actions:
View → Open modal with full stationery detail

Edit → Inline or modal form (PATCH request)

Delete → Show confirmation then DELETE API

🧾 4. ➕ Add New Stationery Entry
Form Fields:
Select Standard (dropdown)

Select Academic Year

Stationery Items (multiselect or dynamic input list)

Quantity per item

Total Fee (optional) – or auto calculate from items

Submit button → Sends POST request

✏️ 5. 🧰 Update Stationery
Use PATCH method to update any part of an existing stationery detail

On editing, form should be pre-filled with existing data

Option to Add / Remove stationery items dynamically

🧼 6. ❌ Delete Stationery Entry
Use DELETE endpoint with appropriate ID

Add confirmation dialog to avoid accidental deletions

📡 7. Required API Integrations (from provided schema):
Make sure you use existing API endpoints and avoid duplicating:

📘 Example API Usage:
Operation	API Route	Method
Get standards with stationery	/api/standards/	GET
Get one standard detail	/api/standards/{id}/	GET
Update stationery per standard	/api/standards/{id}/	PATCH
Create stationery record	/api/standards/ (if separate, use new)	POST
Delete stationery	/api/standards/{id}/	DELETE
Branches	/api/branches/	GET
Academic Years	/api/academic-years/	GET

If the stationery has a separate module in the backend (e.g., /api/stationery-items/), check and use those endpoints instead.

🧠 Developer Notes
Prevent infinite re-fetch loops — add dependencies properly in hooks.

Maintain centralized API service for all requests (apiService.getStationery, apiService.updateStandardStationery, etc.)

Reuse modals and forms from other modules for consistency.
