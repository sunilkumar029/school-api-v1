🎯 1. Fix Broken Functionality
🔧 View Details Buttons Not Working
In the Student Fee Details Page:

Fix the "View Details" button action in:

✅ Pending Fees tab

✅ Payment History tab

📌 Fix: Ensure the modal or bottom sheet that shows full fee/payment info is correctly connected with its action, and the data is passed via ID or object.

🧭 2. Update Sidebar Navigation (Drawer)
🗂 Add New Tabs:
✅ Student Fee Details (if not already in)

✅ Student Fee Analytics (new page)

🏷️ Add "New" Badge:
Use a label or badge (e.g., 🆕 or "NEW") next to newly added menu items to highlight them temporarily.

🧮 3. Enhanced Fee Views – Alerts & Categorization
👁️‍🗨️ View Filters on Student Fee Details Page
Add 3 buttons/filters above or below the tabs:

✅ View Paid Payments

✅ View Pending Payments

✅ Upcoming Due Payments

Filter payments due in next 30 days

Helps staff proactively alert students

🧠 UX Suggestion: Use tab-style buttons or filter chips to switch between these views without breaking context.

📊 4. Student Fee Analytics Page
Create a new screen called StudentFeeAnalytics.tsx (or similar) and route it through the sidebar.

🧾 A. Summary Table
Metric	Value
Total Students	from /api/students/

create the api links that required beaware of creating existing api's 

💡 Developer Notes:
Use hooks and pagination/memoization to avoid infinite API loops

Cache branch/academic-year filter context across screens

Use dropdown + accordion filters (like rest of app)

🧠 Final Notes:
Avoid duplicating existing API functions — check before creating.

Prevent infinite loops in dropdown fetching (memoize calls / use stable hooks).

Ensure UX is mobile-friendly, maintain proper spacing, accordion-based filters, and optimized scroll.
