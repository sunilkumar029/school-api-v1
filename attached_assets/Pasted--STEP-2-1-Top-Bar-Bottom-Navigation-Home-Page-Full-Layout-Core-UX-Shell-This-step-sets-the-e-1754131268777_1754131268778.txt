✅ STEP 2.1 — Top Bar, Bottom Navigation & Home Page Full Layout (Core UX Shell)
This step sets the entire app shell foundation:

📌 Top Bar: Dynamic menu & title

🔽 Bottom Navigation: Home, Notifications, Settings

🏠 Home Page: Clean, user-friendly, role-flexible dashboard layout with smart components

Let’s break it down thoroughly.

🔝 1. TOP BAR (Header Menu)
🎯 Goal:
A unified top app bar that appears across pages with contextual content & actions.

📐 Layout:

Edit
+------------------------------------------------------+
| ≡  Page Title                         🔔  ⚙️        |
+------------------------------------------------------+
Element	Behavior
☰ Menu Icon	Opens Drawer (for optional side features or profile)
Title	Dynamic (changes per page, e.g. “Home”, “Settings”)
🔔 Notifications Icon	Navigates to Notifications tab
⚙️ Settings Icon	Navigates to Settings tab

In Home screen, the drawer can show user info or additional role-based actions later.

📱 Responsive Behavior:
Hide settings icon if already on Settings tab

Enable search or extra actions contextually (e.g. in "Events")

🔽 2. BOTTOM NAVIGATION BAR
📐 Layout:

+------------------------------------------+
| 🏠 Home | 🔔 Notifications | ⚙️ Settings |
+------------------------------------------+
🧭 Tabs:
Tab	Icon	Route	Purpose
Home	🏠	/home	Primary dashboard
Notifications	🔔	/notifications	View latest alerts
Settings	⚙️	/settings	App preferences (theme, font size, etc.)

Later, additional tabs (like “Academics”, “Wallet”, “Chat”) can be injected based on the role.

🏠 3. HOME SCREEN — Layout & UX Strategy
This is the most critical screen and must serve as a dashboard + quick action center.

🔍 Design Goals:
Clean, intuitive overview

Role-flexible data widgets

Prioritized info (attendance, events, requests, tasks)

Quick access to common actions

📐 Visual Layout Breakdown (Top-to-Bottom):

1. Top Greeting Header
2. Overview Cards Section
3. Quick Action Buttons Grid
4. Recent Activity Section
5. Upcoming Events Section
6. Announcements / Notices
1. 👋 Greeting Header
Info	Example
Dynamic Greeting	“Good Morning, Mr. Ramesh”
Profile Pic	Circular avatar
Role Display	“Admin” or “Student” tag
School Name	e.g., “Visionaries International”

2. 📊 Overview Cards Section
Use horizontally scrollable stat cards:

Card Title	Icon	Sample Value
Attendance	📅	96%
Events Today	📌	3 Events
Tasks Due	📋	2 Pending
Leaves Left	🏖	4 Days
Balance Wallet	💰	₹1,250

These cards are visually attractive, use gradient backgrounds or shadow.

3. ⚡ Quick Action Grid
Grid of 4 or 6 tappable icons (role-aware), like:

Action	Icon
Apply Leave	📝
View Timetable	🕒
Mark Attendance	✅
Chat	💬
Online Class	🎥
Raise Request	📢

Each opens the related module. Highlight top-used actions per role.

4. 🕵️ Recent Activity Section
Mini feed-style layout showing:

✅ Approved leave request

📢 Event added

🕒 Timesheet filled

💬 New message from admin

Max 3–4 items. “View All” opens full notification/activity screen.

5. 📅 Upcoming Events Section
A calendar-style strip or list of today/tomorrow’s events:

Title	Time	Type
Science Fair	10 AM	Campus Event
Online Class	2 PM	Zoom

6. 📣 Announcements / Notices
Slide-style or stacked list for:

🎓 Exam Notice

📢 Circulars

📅 Holiday Info

These can be fetched from the “Notification & Latest Activity” module.

🧰 COMPONENT STRATEGY
We'll break Home into reusable components:

Component	Purpose
TopBar	App header with title & icons
OverviewCard	Each stat box
QuickActionButton	Icon + label shortcuts
EventItem	Mini event preview
RecentActivityItem	Feed style item
AnnouncementBanner	Marquee or stack layout
