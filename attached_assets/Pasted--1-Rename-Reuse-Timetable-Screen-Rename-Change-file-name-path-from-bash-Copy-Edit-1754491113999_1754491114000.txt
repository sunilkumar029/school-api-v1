🧭 1. Rename & Reuse: Timetable Screen
🏷️ Rename:
Change file name/path from:

bash
Copy
Edit
/academics/timetable.tsx
→ /academics/staff-timetable.tsx
🔁 Reuse:
Use staff-timetable's table structure, logic, and UI as the base.

Ensure:

Period table

Department dropdown

Teacher rows

Day selection

Timetable cells interaction (as previously mentioned) are retained.

🌐 2. Global Filter Behavior for All Screens
Across all relevant pages, implement the following filter structure:

🔍 Common Filters:
Branch Dropdown → Use /api/branches/

Academic Year Dropdown → Use /api/academic-years/

Search Input (student/staff name)

📦 Layout:
Use a simple accordion-style "Add Filters" button

On click → expands filter panel

Keep it minimal, non-intrusive for scrolling

Do not group filters unnecessarily (e.g., “All” or “Both” selections) — keep filters separate and clearly labeled.

💡 UX Enhancements:
Prefetch branches and academic years once

Use useEffect with memoized/stable dependency arrays to avoid infinite loops

💳 3. Students Fee List Page
📃 Page Features:
Table/List of Students

Show: Name, Standard, Section, Total Fee, Pending Fee, Paid Fee

Actions: View (navigates to fee detail)

🎛 Filters:
Common: Branch, Academic Year, Search

Additional:

Standard Dropdown

Section Dropdown (dynamically fetched based on standard/branch)

Fee Range Filter:

Use slider or numeric inputs

Greater than (min)

Less than (max)

👤 4. Specific Student Fee Details Page
🧾 Sections:
📌 A. Pending Fees
List of pending fees with:

Fee type

📌 B. Payment History
Table/List:

Payment method

Term / Fee type

implement the new ones, beware of the existing apis 

🧠 Final Notes:
Avoid duplicating existing API functions — check before creating.

Prevent infinite loops in dropdown fetching (memoize calls / use stable hooks).

Ensure UX is mobile-friendly, maintain proper spacing, accordion-based filters, and optimized scroll.
